# RT_distributed_task_scheduling_CAN_BUS
Project developed in the last year of my degree in Computer Engineer.

It implements a case scenario with three Tiva TM4C123GH6PM boards connected through CAN bus scheduling and synchronizing some Real-Time tasks executed in all of them with different priorities and task loads.
The goal is to make sure all the artificial tasks starting in different nodes are executed on time.
